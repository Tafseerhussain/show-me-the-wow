				                    	If your product is a prototype, and has a patent, or is patent pending that will have a patented outcome, you will have 50% of all profits after expenses. Show Me The Wow (SMTW), will receive the other 50%.  If it’s just an original idea, and SMTW has to help secure the patent, then SMTW will receive 75% and you as the inventor/entrepreneur will receive 25%.

				                    	More than fair.  Most inventors who submit a patent and prototype to a distributor normally get 2% to 5% of profits, after expenses.  “Ideas” rarely get looked at, and usually do not get anything at all, until you have a patent.   Even after receiving a patent, that is still no guarantee of finding a distributor.

If there’s no meeting of the minds, we will regrettably have to eliminate both of you from the competition.

				                	When I submit the idea, and it’s seen on the show and other social media sites, how do I protect myself once I submit my idea into SMTW to ensure nobody copies it?

				                    	There’s always a risk, but we will have our team start the process, which will include our legal team who will start the process of submitting copyrights, trademarks, and begin the adventure of developing your idea or prototype to make it a reality.  We also have distribution partners that will get it out as soon as it is produced, tested, and ready so it can be first to market.
